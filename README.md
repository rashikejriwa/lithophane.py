## Project Description
#### Lithophane.py is a program that creates lithophane models which are pieces of art or images that are only seen when backlit by an external light source. A stl file that can be used to 3D print the lithophane model will be generated based on user image input and the geometry selected along with other customizable options such as border and thickness.

## How To Run The Project
#### To use the program, run the userInterface.py. Then input the number of faces, border thickness, and the height of each face pannel. Click the save inputs button. Next, upload the same number of images as the number of faces. Click the generate STL button which will save the model to the users desktop. Finally, click refresh model to view your 3D lithophane.
